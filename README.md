This is an adapter board for the [QVADRANS 1.0/Lepton 3.0 board] (https://community.simplefoc.com/t/qvadrans-v1-0-fka-lepton-3-0/3376) to break out connectors and pins to a usable/easily testable form factor. 

I've made a few of these successfully so far, but YMMV so make sure the board's what you want before having them made.
